# Git GUIs

GUIs (graphical user interfaces) allow you to use Git using point and click software, rather than unix commands through a command line interface.


#### Stand alone git GUIS
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is free and open source

#### Git integrations within IDEs (integrated development environments)
* If you are an RStudio user, RStudio has easy to use git interactions
* If you are writing Python code, PyCharm has git integrations
