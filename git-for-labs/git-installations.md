# Git Installations

To get started with Git on the command line, we need to install some system-level dependencies.

#### Installing Dependencies on macOS

You may have Git installed by default if you have a Mac. In order to check this, run `git --version` in your terminal window. (Locate your terminal window in Applications > Utilities > Terminal, or by searching for "Terminal" in the Spotlight search bar).

Reference [this installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for more information about installing Git on a Mac). 

#### Installing Dependencies on Windows

If you use Windows, the easiest way to install the required dependencies is to download and install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win), a Unix-like terminal for Windows. After clicking the link above, click on the installer and accept all defaults.

Once that installs, you should be able to click on the Windows icon in the lower-left-hand corner of your taskbar, search for "Git Bash", and click on the Git Bash icon:

That should bring up a terminal that's fully equipped with Git.
