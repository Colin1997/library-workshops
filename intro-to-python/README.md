# Intro to Python [work in progress]

This is the landing page for the Intro to Python workshop held by Yale's Cushing/Whitney Medical Library. If you have any questions about this class or the content, email medicaldata@yale.edu. 


### Running the Workshop Notebook in Google Colab

There are two notebooks associated with this class. These notebooks will allow you to use Python in your web browser. Since these notebooks will run in your web browser and not on your local machine, a Python installation is not nessissary in order to participate in this class.
